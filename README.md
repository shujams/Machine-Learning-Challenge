Exploratory data analysis using machine learning tools.

SVM Training Data Score: 0.8420751478161358
SVM Testing Data Score: 0.8381006864988558

Logistic Regression Training Data Score: 0.8512302117108526
Logistic Regression Testing Data Score: 0.847254004576659

Normal Neural Network - Loss: 0.2739448269117342, Accuracy: 0.8838672637939453

In our analysis, the Normal Neural Network (NNN) had the highest predictive accuracy at 88.39%. The neural network analyzed the data on three deep layers, while SVM and LR looked at the data as a whole, single layer. This is perhaps why our NNN model had the highest accuracy.

Based on our data, the scanning of deep space for gamma rays ({'C': 10, 'gamma': 0.0001}, 0.8649640879354384) may prove to be a strong course of action.
